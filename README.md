# Sign&#183;a&#183;mander
This is a mobile application built on React Native for my Undergraduate Honors Thesis Research Project, *Sign-a-mander: A Mobile App That Enhances ASL Learning with Computer Vision*. This project investigates Dongxu Li et al.'s I3D sign language recognition model and whether implementing it in a mobile application is feasible.
