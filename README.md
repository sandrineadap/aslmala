# Sign&#183;a&#183;mander

![alt text](./thumbnail-readme.png)

This is a mobile application built on React Native for my Undergraduate Honors Thesis Research Project, *Sign-a-mander: A Mobile App That Enhances ASL Learning with Computer Vision*. This project investigates Dongxu Li et al.'s I3D sign language recognition model and whether implementing it in a mobile application is feasible.

Below is a mockup diagram of my design for the application. I highlight the main design choices on pages 7 and 8 of my research paper linked above. You may also download a PDF version of the diagram by clicking the download button on [this page](./public/Sign-a-mander_mockup.pdf).
